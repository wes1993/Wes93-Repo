For now there are two addons:
YouTube-Stream-Repeater       --> Without HTTPS and Username/Password protection, should be used in conjuction with a Proxy server on top of it.
YouTube-Stream-Repeater-HTTPS --> With HTTPS and Basic User/Passwors authentication, this is an all-in-one solution, just install the addon in HA.
